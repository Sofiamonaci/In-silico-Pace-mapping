## ABOUT

This computational platform can be used to generate in-silico pace-maps from clinical/simulated ECGs/EGMs paces and simulated/clinical VT ECGs/EGMs to **localise critical ablation targets of post-infarct VTs (e.g. exits, entrances, isthmuses) non-invasively**.

Python scripts only require basic libraries such as numpy, padas, os, sys, argparse
